## Chrome Apps Developer Tool (ADT) for Android

The Chrome ADT for Android is a standalone Android app that allows you to download and run a Chrome App without setting up the development toolchain as described above. Use the Chrome ADT when you want to quickly preview an existing Chrome App (already packaged as a .crx) on your Android device.

The Chrome ADT for Android is currently in a pre-alpha release. To try it out, view the [ChromeADT.apk release notes](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/harness/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha) for installation and usage instructions.
