# Chrome Apps for Mobile

APIs, integration ~~shiv~~ shim and tests for running Chrome Apps on mobile using Apache Cordova.

These tools are at a very early pre-alpha stage. Don't use them; you have been warned.

## Components

* APIs live under `api/`.
* Chrome-spec test suite is in `spec/`.
* Integration bits and instructions are in `integration/`.
