# Chrome Apps for Mobile

This repo contains plugins for [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) that make it easier to port [Chrome Packaged Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/apps) to iOS and Android applications.

If you'd like to test out mobile chrome apps, refer to the [mobile-chrome-apps](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps) repo.

## Components

* APIs live under `plugins/`.
* Chrome-spec test suite is in `spec/`.
