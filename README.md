# Chrome Packaged Apps for Mobile

This repo contains tools for creating [Chrome Packaged Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/apps) that
run as native Android and iOS applications through [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/).

Check out the documentation in the `docs/` directory. You'll probably want to start with the Installation guide.
